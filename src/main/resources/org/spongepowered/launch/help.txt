  Oops! You attempted to run the Sponge Forge Mod directly!

  This jar file is a mod for Minecraft Forge. You can run this file as a Forge
  mod by installing Minecraft Forge and simply dropping the jar file into the
  Forge "mods" directory. You can get Minecraft Forge from:

    http://files.minecraftforge.net/

  Once you have downloaded and installed Forge, you can load Sponge as a mod.


  Alternatively, for headless server installations you can use this Sponge jar
  as a launcher for Minecraft Forge. To use the jar as a launcher, you can:

    1) Install Minecraft Forge and the dependencies by running:

        java -jar ${jarfile} install

    2) Run Minecraft Forge with Sponge by running

        java -jar ${jarfile} run {args}
